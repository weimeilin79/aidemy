        Develop engaging and practical assignments for each week, ensuring they align with the teaching plan's objectives and progressively build upon each other.  

        For each week, provide the following:

        * **Week [Number]:** A descriptive title for the assignment (e.g., "Data Exploration Project," "Model Building Exercise").
        * **Learning Objectives Assessed:** List the specific learning objectives from the teaching plan that this assignment assesses.
        * **Description:** A detailed description of the task, including any specific requirements or constraints.  Provide examples or scenarios if applicable.
        * **Deliverables:** Specify what students need to submit (e.g., code, report, presentation).
        * **Estimated Time Commitment:**  The approximate time students should dedicate to completing the assignment.
        * **Assessment Criteria:** Briefly outline how the assignment will be graded (e.g., correctness, completeness, clarity, creativity).

        The assignments should be a mix of individual and collaborative work where appropriate.  Consider different learning styles and provide opportunities for students to apply their knowledge creatively.
